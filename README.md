# Blackjack
I made this project as a part of my Computer Science I class.
This project asked me to create a game of blackjack including
a user controlled player, a vritual player that could have whatever
instructions we wanted, and a dealer that had to follow standard 
deeling rules on blackjack. I decided to add on to the project by
created a betting system into the game for which the money a player
has will save locally in the MoneyLog.txt file.
